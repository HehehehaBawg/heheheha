first copy this link then press import repository and it will import. after its imported go to the page and go to setting and find the pages. then just launch and u have fnaf 4 and you have your own site. (forgot to mention you need to name your repository (whatever you name is).github.io and then it will make a site) anyways this took me a while to do so please star it <3
